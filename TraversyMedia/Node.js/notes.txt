Node Js

JavaScript Runtime (Not a language or a framework)
Built on V8 JavaScript engine
Written in C++
Essentially allows us to run JavaScript code on the server.

Works on a single thread using non-blocking I/O calls
It is asynchronous.

Single threaded
Supports concurrency via events and callbacks
EventEmitter class is used to bind events and listeners.

Node is not good for cpu intensive tasks like long calculations.

Packages get stored in the "node_modules" folder
All dependencies are listed in a "package.json" file
NPM scripts can be created to run certain tasks such as run a server

npm init                  Generates a package.json file
npm install express       Installs a package locally
npm install -g nodemon    Installs a package globally

If you move to a different computer where all dependecies used in your project are not present use command: npm install uuid
This will install the dependency uuid

For adding dev dependencies use -D
Eg: npm install -D nodemon

if you want to install everything in package.json automatically then use command: npm install.
This will create node modules(if you don't have) and place everything inside it.

If you wanna run the js file simply type node index.js in terminal
Here index.js is the filename.
